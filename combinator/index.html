<!-- A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors,
we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

1. descendant selector (space): This selector is used to select all the child elements of 
   the specified tag. The tags can be the direct child of the specified tag or can be very 
   deep in the specified tag. This combinator combines the two selectors such that selected 
   elements have an ancestor same as the first selector element.

2. child selector (>): This selector is used to select the element that is the immediate
   child of the specified tag. This combinator is stricter than the descendant selector 
   because it selects only the second selector if it has the first selector element as its parent. 

3. adjacent sibling selector (+): The Adjacent sibling selector is used to select the 
   element that is adjacent or the element that is the next to the specified selector 
   tag. This combinator selects only one tag that is just next to the specified tag.

4. general sibling selector (~) : The general sibling selector is used to select the element 
   that follows the first selector element and also share the same parent as the first selector 
   element. This can be used to select a group of elements that share the same parent element.
